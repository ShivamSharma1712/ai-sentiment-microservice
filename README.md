AI Sentiment Analysis Microservice

Overview
This project implements an AI-powered Sentiment Analysis Microservice designed using microservice architecture principles. The service performs real-time sentiment inference on unstructured customer feedback using a combination of a custom Artificial Neural Network, Hugging Face transformer models, and the VADER sentiment analyzer.

The microservice is intended to be consumed by a CRM backend system and therefore does not include a standalone frontend user interface.


Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

* Automatically analyze unstructured customer feedback
* Extract sentiment polarity and intensity
* Detect linguistic patterns such as negation, mixed sentiment, and sarcasm
* Expose functionality through REST APIs
* Enable seamless integration with CRM systems


Architecture Design

The sentiment analysis component is implemented as an independent backend microservice. It is accessed by the CRM backend via REST APIs, while the CRM frontend interacts only with the backend services.

The microservice operates independently and can be deployed, updated, or scaled without impacting other system components.


Technologies Used

Backend Framework
Flask

API Documentation
Swagger using Flask-RESTX

Machine Learning
Artificial Neural Network implemented using TensorFlow and Keras

Natural Language Processing
Hugging Face Transformers and VADER Sentiment Analyzer

Feature Extraction
TF-IDF Vectorization

Containerization
Docker

Deployment Platform
Render Cloud


Machine Learning Approach

Custom ANN Model
A regression-based Artificial Neural Network is trained offline using TF-IDF features extracted from customer reviews. The model outputs a continuous sentiment intensity score.

Hugging Face Transformer Model
A pretrained DistilBERT-based sentiment classification model is used to capture contextual and semantic meaning in text.

VADER Sentiment Analyzer
VADER is used for rule-based sentiment scoring, particularly effective for short and informal customer feedback.

Linguistic Feature Detection
The system also detects linguistic cues such as negation, mixed sentiment, and potential sarcasm to improve interpretability.


API Endpoints

Health Check Endpoint
GET /sentiment/health

Returns the operational status of the microservice and confirms that models are loaded successfully.


Sentiment Prediction Endpoint
POST /sentiment/predict

Accepts customer feedback text and returns sentiment scores generated by the ANN model, Hugging Face model, and VADER, along with detected linguistic flags.


API Documentation

Interactive API documentation is available using Swagger UI. This allows evaluators and developers to test the microservice without requiring a frontend interface.

The documentation can be accessed using the following endpoint:

/docs


Deployment Information

The microservice is deployed as a cloud-based backend service. It does not include a frontend interface by design, as it is intended to be consumed programmatically by other services such as a CRM backend.

The application is container-ready and can be deployed using Docker or cloud platforms that support Python-based web services.


Important Evaluation Clarification

This project follows microservice architecture principles. Since the sentiment analysis module is a backend AI service, it does not have a standalone frontend. The correctness and functionality of the system can be verified using its REST APIs and Swagger documentation, which is standard practice for backend microservices.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates a production-ready AI microservice capable of analyzing customer sentiment efficiently and at scale. The system is modular, scalable, and suitable for real-world CRM applications.
